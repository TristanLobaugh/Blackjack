#Blackjack game using jQuery, HTML and CSS

###Setup the table using Bootstrap. Create a dealers hand and players hand to hold the toals.
Set each card to a custom width(adjusted col-sm-2 to 11% to avoid having to write 3 extra divs).
Add 3 button to the bottom of the table so the user can interact with the game.
###Write some Javascript
Bind each button to a jQuery click function and call the correct function depending on the click.
